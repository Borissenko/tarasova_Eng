                <i> “Pianist Elena Tarasova is distinguished not only by her dedication in her profession, but also by such qualities as honesty and sincerity towards others and herself. In her game, it is noticeable especially: there is no fuss, the desire to please and please the listener, and as a result of this - the mannerism and imitation of fashion - themselves are left far away, and the human nobility is harmoniously combined with performing nobility. Years of performing activity allowed Elena Tarasova to create an extensive repertoire, the main feature of which is not only the proximity of each individual work to the inner world of the artist, but its relevance and “universalness”. Whether it is Baroque essays or opuses of composers of the 20th century - they all give an idea of ​​the high taste of the performer and his ability to separate the unconditional valuable from the secondary and minor ...

Elena Tarasova subtly and soulfully performed the solo works of Chopin, Rachmaninov, Liszt, and also proved to be a sensitive partner in the performance of chamber music for violin and piano. These speeches delighted both the general public and highly skilled professionals in Germany and found an enthusiastic response in the press. "</i>

And this means that the school of great pianists is alive, and we are witnesses of that.

Beloved by both composers and listeners at different times, the form of variations is developed by Mozart with masterly skill. The inexhaustible fantasy of the writer makes me dress in the most unthinkable outfits familiar melodies familiar to Mozart's contemporaries. Impeccable skill, delightful grace, subtle cunning, brilliant humor and sweet coquetry - Elena Tarasova's generous gift is rewarded with deafening applause. "</i>

The “roundness” of phrasing, the working out and meaningfulness of the details, the flawless small technique - all this along with the desire to “convey the image of the composition” rather than “build the image of a virtuoso soloist”. Quality, not so frequent among modern pianists, often to the "sportiness". At the same time, I wanted to find out in the future how this “image” will take shape at the pianist in concerts of other composers, completely different in their appearance: let's say, Brahms or Shostakovich ... ”. </i>

The concert became an undoubted event in the cultural life of the city. Elena Tarasova showed herself as a talented musician with impeccable professional background, an organic sensation and understanding of the composer’s style. High ensemble qualities of the performer, a sincere and genuine sense of copyright humor in music, brilliance and sparkling of the piano technique, as well as fiery emotionality along with artistic relaxedness and freedom of music playing ensured the great success of the young pianist in the concert.

                <i> <span style = "font-weight: 400;"> Dear friends, </span> <span style = "font-weight: 400;">
                </span> <span style = "font-weight: 400;"> We are pleased to inform you about the first review on Elena's disk “Sound Illusions. Collage ”(label“ Neue Sterne ”). The review was published in the new issue of the authoritative European magazine "Piano News" (5/2018, September - October). Music critic Carsten Durer praised. Below we publish its review in translation. Note also that the disc received the maximum score for the interpretation and sound. </span>

                </span>
                <span style = "font-weight: 400;"> “The pianist Elena Tarasova, who was educated in Moscow, almost did not speak at our place. She gives concerts mainly in Russia and in France. On her new disc with the note "Rising stars" there is a program that starts with the piece “Valse oubliée” No. 1 and ends with “La Valse” by Ravel, combining the thoughts and dreams of Debussy, Saint-Saens, Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. Worthy of note is, above all, the high culture of the carcass of a 34-year-old pianist, who superbly manages to make the instrument sound according to the composer’s plan. She immerses the listener in a warm and deep sound in Tchaikovsky's Reverie du soir, while Rachmaninoff's selected preludes sometimes have a rather powerful carcass, which constantly stirs interest in playing the pianist. In general, it is easily penetrated by a variety of musical ideas. “Les cloches du </span> <span style =" font-weight: 400; "> soir" Debussy is as colorful a sketch on the evening bells of church bells as "La vallée des cloches" by his compatriot Ravel. The pianist always correctly selects agogika, and with the help of phrasing she manages to reveal the images hidden in the music. A magnificent recording of a well-thought-out and well-built program of a musician, about which one wants to learn more. ”
