<b> Project Press Release: </b>
<p> January 7, 2009 marks the 110th anniversary of the birth of the French composer, pianist, critic, member of the association "Les SIx" Francis Poulenc. A cycle of monographic programs is timed to this date, allowing F. Poulenc to present the composer's legacy very widely, as well as a number of concerts devoted to the music of his contemporaries, which meets another goal of the project - to recreate the musical atmosphere of the era in which the composer lived and worked. </ P >
<p> An important aspect of our activities in the framework of the project is to provide opportunities for further study of the little-known works of F. Poulenc in Russia. Copies of scores and claviers ordered from the Salabert and Eschig publishing houses will be donated to the S. Taneyev Scientific Music Library fund of the Moscow Conservatory for use exclusively for scientific and educational purposes while respecting the copyright law. </p>
<p> The project was supported by the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation, the Moscow State Conservatory named after P. Tchaikovsky, the Concert Philharmonic Society "Mosconcert", the French Embassy in the Russian Federation, the French Cultural Center, the radio station of classical music "Orpheus", the Publishing House "Classic XXI", the Holding "MIEL". </p>

<h3> Photo exhibition concept. </ h3><br>
<p> “Preparing for any festival is a huge job. A lot of people are involved, a lot of organizational issues are being solved. Huge preparation from the point of view of filling the action. The music festival is an even more difficult task. Music is one of the most powerful means affecting a person’s emotions, his mood, his character ... As a result, the musicians themselves are very interesting and vibrant people. Preparing for a concert or festival is not just an ordinary action for them. This is the work for which they live. Labor, which sometimes becomes heavy to tears, but which they will never give up. </p>

<p> As a rule, we, ordinary listeners, do not see all this. We used to just come to the concert, just listen and enjoy the music. But those events that preceded the organization of the concert can be as interesting for the listener as the concert itself. </p>

<p> <b> The purpose of the photo series: </b> to show those moments that would be interesting to the visitor of the concert. Each person is unique and interesting, and a person is doubly interesting at moments of creativity! The task to reveal and show these images is very delicate. This should not turn into an annoying interference with someone's work (soul, feelings), or be a search for an abstract, blurred image. It should be a beautiful report, even if partly staged. Or a picture. This is a description of life and creativity in it. " </p>
<br>
<p> Pavel Tchannikov. </p>
