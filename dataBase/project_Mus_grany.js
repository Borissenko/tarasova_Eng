“Equinox” (translated from English - equinox) is one of the unique phenomena of nature, a symbolic point of balance in space. The authors of the programs “Musical Faces” are trying to find this symbolic balance in the field of music, unification within a single concert, the composition of the classical repertoire, performance for stage performance, opuses for “other purposes”, namely, music of intellectual cinema.
<br>
<br>
<b> Elena Tarasova, author of the project idea: </b> “The word“ Equinox ”, the original name of which is its main goal - to combine in one program works for concert performance and film music, which will acquire here an“ independent, non-illustrative life ”. Perhaps it will not even gain, but return it. At least, the plots devoted to Italian cinema are amazing and interesting in their own right, and they can easily find their concert “niche” among the works of composers of the 20th century ... ”.
<br>
<br>
<b> In the first part of the concerts </b> well-known works by C. Debussy, F. Poulenc and two repertoire rarities will be performed by I. Stravinsky's “Circus Polka composed for the Young Elephant” and Jean Frans opus, which deserves special attention. Suite Frances, The Hourly Shepherds (literal translation - “Hour Dating”) is sketches from the life of Parisian cafes, witty descriptions of three types of people who were observed by the composer. The instruments “turn” into the elderly dandies - sighing, they recall the good old days. In the second part (“Spectacular girls with covers”), the author portrays flirty ladies, who are admired by admirers. In the finale ("Little Fidgets") all the tools easily and quickly "worn" like children, until they catch adults.
<br>
<br>
<b> In the second part </b> there will be music by Astor Piazzolla from the films of Mark Bellochko “Henry IV” and Fernando Esequiel Solanas “Tango. The Exile of Gardel ”, also the music of Nino Roth and Nicolas Pyovani for the film Federico Fellini (“ The Road ”,“ Ginger and Fred ”). Listeners will learn about the activities of these composers and outside the cinema, about their revision with the world of academic music. For example, A. Piazzolla took piano lessons from S. Rakhmaninov, performed his compositions together with M. Rostropovich; and Nino Rota was also known as a composer and conductor in the conservatory as a prodigy.
<br>
<br>
<b> Maria Bakun, Project Coordinator: </b> “Within the framework of the project“ Musical Faces / Equinox ”) we invite Alexander Maslovsky, a talented young composer from St. Petersburg, to collaborate ... Symphonic plots from the music for the F.Fellini film“ Ginger and Fred "" And "The Road" is a rare guest on Russian stages. Alexandra Maslovskaya performed a responsible and interesting work - to shift one of the scores to a new, chamber composition of performers ... ”.
<br>
<br>
Alexandra Maslovskaya, composer: </b> "I was interested in this work - in terms of cooperation with the Moscow music world and in a purely professional sense." I wanted to touch the music of a great classic and a new genre of music for me. After all, the music of Italian cinema is based on two traditions: on the one hand, on the tradition of serious academic music, on the other, on a quality stage like it was in the middle of the 20th century ... ”.
