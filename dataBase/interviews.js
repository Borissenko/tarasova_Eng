The formats of 3D films, drawing with 3D pens, computer games with incredible graphics are increasingly popular among the generation of young people. Watching this, I understand that the common denominator of all these fascinating phenomena is probably the same - the desire to make reality more vivid, voluminous, colored with its colors, plots, fantasies; the desire to learn new worlds that have appeared in human imagination, the desire for a miracle. But after all, new worlds — mysterious, mysterious, enthralling, leaving an indelible mark on your soul — can be discovered in a space closer to us, more “alive”, namely, in the space of creativity and art. This is also a kind of 3D space - three-dimensional, bright, the key to which you need to find.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> We are in dialogue with our recent guest; It can be said that this is a continuation of an unfinished conversation. We met again with the laureate of international competitions, pianist Elena Tarasova and talk about the first meetings with art, current trends of the metropolis and how to find the way to your creative “me.” </b> <br> <br>
<b> - Elena, you started making music early - at the age of four. Do you remember your first encounters with the art of music and impressions of these meetings? </b>
<br> <br>
I suppose my first impressions are connected more with theatrical art. My mother - a pianist - at that time worked in a youth theater. I can not call myself a child that grew up behind the scenes, but I often attended rehearsals. And at the performances of the theater, of course, too.
Parents loved drama theater and the art of ballet - I took that love from them. Probably the brightest impression of the preschool period is S. Cinderella's ballet by S. Prokofiev, to which they took me to the Kremlin Palace of Congresses. As for the strong impressions of the music, outside the synthesis of the arts - it was later. I was about seven years old, I was already at school at the conservatory. I think after this encounter with art, I began to understand that music is not just a beautiful sound with which we play what we read in the notes; it is something more having a strong influence. <br> <br>
 <b> - Tell me? </b> <br> <br>
This meeting happened almost by accident. A tape recorder with a built-in radio appeared at home. There were also tapes with different records, but I listened to them more than once. And here, I twist a plastic wheel, I look for some radio station. Interference, appearing sounds, interference again ... Among these noises, the melody became more and more distinguishable - sad, gentle, a little dancing. She answered the orchestra. Handsomely! Trying to catch a radio wave more precisely. The broadcast becomes clearer, the sound is more confident ... I can not move away from the speaker - and I stand at the tape recorder ... I remember, I cried - from this perfect beauty of the inexplicable, crystal-clear world that opened so unexpectedly, almost by accident. It was a deep emotional shock. The pause between the last chord and the voice of the announcer seemed like an eternity - I wanted to find out how this music was called, but ... probably, the piece had already been said before, before the start of the broadcast ... Wiping away tears, I thought that before our random meeting with this music, I was different, that I changed during these minutes, and I was sure that we will meet with this music again, and I will know what this composition is called and who this great author is. <br> <br>
 <b> - Did you find out? </b> <br> <br>Yes, some time later. This work was the finale of Chopin's Second Concerto for Piano and Orchestra. Now, when I address him as a performer, I recall our first acquaintance - the bright room, the sun's rays, looking in the window, the sounds of music from the speaker, the excitement and tears of the inexplicable, open only now happiness ... <br> <br>
<b> - How to discover this world of art? How to hear find the key to it? And will he be without special education and sufficient erudition? </b> <br> <br>
Let's imagine that you first come to an art gallery or a concert hall. Go from picture to picture, gaze in trying to solve something, or listen to music and guiltily catch yourself thinking that it is getting boring ... Very soon there is an overwhelming desire to relax and a steady feeling that this art is not yours. Often such unsuccessful first acquaintances take place in childhood and become decisive in the attitude of a person to painting or classical music. And meanwhile, at first meetings with art one does not need to try to analyze something and, moreover, to have encyclopedic knowledge. You just need to feel that you are attracted, what mood tells you this creation. Feeling is the main key that opens the door to this bright and voluminous world; erudition, knowledge - as well as further deep scientific research! - always grow out of interest, which gives us a feeling. <br> <br>
<b> - That is, you should not postpone the first meeting with art for “later, when there is time and enough knowledge” ... </b> <br> <br>
Exactly. Moscow’s current cultural life is impressive; Concert halls, museums, theaters offer a variety of interesting events. However, for the first meetings I will propose to turn not to the experimental theater or modern musical art, but to the time-tested classics. Immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the performance of an academic theater or a romantic piano monologue - an agitated, tender, sensitive musical statement ... Is it a monologue? Not. I believe the dialogue - with you. <br> <br>
 <b> - Dialogue? What do you mean? </b> <br> <br>Each composition of the composer is to some extent autobiographical, unique, and each one is a little yours. Creating a particular opus, the composer creates a whole world - experiences, feelings, ideas, images. The writing is recorded on note paper, published ... and finds its place in the treasury of world art. But written music should sound - then she lives! <br>
The process of creating the interpretation of the composition is always a dialogue between the composer and the performer, occurring out of time; this is contact with the spiritual world of extraordinary power created by a person in moments of bright insight or deep spiritual experiences ... These meetings cannot pass without a trace, they bring up the soul, raise it to new heights of feelings ... Each performing musician presents his understanding of the world imprinted in sounds and gives this music a piece of his soul. You, mister listener, also participate in this communication - after all, the musical composition that you hear from the stage is also communication with you. The music in the concert hall is a sound illusion of special power, turned to the soul, imagination, and intellect of everyone present at the concert; but the impression from this meeting for everyone will be a special, personal response, peculiar to your soul. By the way, this response may be creative - under the impression of all that has been heard, verse lines will appear, or during the way to home, sketched sketches in the margins of a working notebook will turn into a drawing. And it is beautiful! Your creativity, your feeling, yourself begins in this response. <br> <br>
<b> - ... that is, a strong impression of a meeting with art opens the door to the world of its own creativity. A step towards your creative "I", the existence of which before these impressions you, perhaps, was not known. </b> <br> <br>
Yes. If I may, I will tell one story from my touring life. It was in Yoshkar-Ola. A wonderful bright hall (it was a concert at a music school), very attentive listeners ... After the concert, I walked around the beautiful autumn city ... At the hotel a lady administrator approached me and handed a letter. The author of that letter put only his initials. Who is he - I still do not know, and yet I would like to thank him for the creative impulse of a sensitive soul. In that envelope were two sheets - one notebook in a cell, on which were written poems, the second - a piece of notebook with another small poem impressed by the concert and drawing. Most of all, then I was struck by the drawing - in the unity of the plot, images existed and were interconnected, with many of which the concert program I chose for me was associated. Of course, that author could not know about my thoughts ... This story happened a long time ago. I still keep the envelope with these drawings - this is not only a pleasant memory of the event, attention and sensitive listener's soul, but also a valuable creation that appeared at the moment of inspiration. <br> <br>
<b> - What a wonderful story! </b> <br> <br>
Yes ... But if we look at the topic of our conversation more deeply and take a look at the history of art - you will see that there are many examples of new masterpieces in one direction under the impression that came from another. <br> <br>
 <b> - Yes, art can inspire! Moreover, not only for creativity, but also for life. And it is very important not to lose the opportunity to meet with art today, in our time of technological breakthroughs. </b> <br> <br>
- It seems to me that I still belong to the younger modern generation, / laughs / however, many technical innovations are already on the sidelines for me. <br> <br>
<b> - Why? </b> <br> <br>
Perhaps, because I see more and more couples of young people who look not into each other’s eyes, but on the screens of their phones. Communication of friends is increasingly moving to social networks - it seems that there is no time for a meeting; the illusion of the possibility of “being connected” via the Internet does not contribute to the search for this time. It turns out that these remarkable achievements of progress are increasingly separating people ... Hearing yourself, your own voice is becoming more difficult - because the pace of life is incredibly high, the flow of information is huge, and free minutes of time are spent communicating on the Internet or television, which in its own way interferes with human relations. I remember the words of Tonino Guerra: “.. the voice coming out of the soulless mechanism fills the silence that reigns between a man and a woman, between parents and children. We should go back to where the word has been returned to our children again, and the images ripen in our imagination ... ”. <br>
An attentive or loving gaze, a kind word spoken on time, an unexpectedly successful sketch for himself in the margin of a notebook, a “live” book in his hands, an impression from a meeting with art not in reproduction of fine quality posted on the Internet, but in the original in a museum, evening in the concert hall in the company of friends and sharing impressions after the concert - all these are moments of happiness of our only life. I am not ready to give them to the innovations of technical progress - with all due respect for scientific thought and periodic reference in the work to its fruits. <br> <br>
<b> - So, we can make the following conclusion: communication with classical art today is what is especially important for a modern person in a megacity with a lot of information received, work tasks and distanced electronic communication. This is an opportunity to fill your life with harmony, to feel and be impressed by the beautiful - and to discuss what you see with friends who came with you. </b> <br> <br>
Yes. This is an opportunity to rethink something. Literature or drama theater as a model of the world ... Human characters, relationships, the structure of society, so detailed, traced by Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and many others. Together with the heroes of a literary novel or performance, we look for answers to questions, look at the situation from the outside. This is a mirror for each of us, which encourages us to reflect on important life issues and allows us to become better. <br> <br>
 <b> - At the end of our conversation, tell us about your concert plans. Maybe you invite our readers to some of your concert? </b> <br> <br>
 I am pleased to invite you! My concert season in Moscow will begin on September 1st. There will be many different programs. But I would especially like to remind you of the project “Opus Universum”, which is already known to the readers of your previous issues of the magazine. The international musical project "Opus Universum" (lat. "Opus universum" - "universal work", "universal creation", "whole profession") brings together performers, each of which could be a phrase by actor and theater director Juozas Miltinis “Not look for something new in art, look for the eternal. " Appeal to the eternal - and therefore always new - implies a deep spiritual search and courage of creative solutions; "Whole profession" is a way of life. The project “Opus Universum” selects the format of concert cycles. The first of these will be the “Music of Time” cycle, representing in the programs the trends of large-scale eras and various directions that are shorter in the time period, but no less important and significant. Project concerts will be held on the scene of the Central Museum of Musical Culture named after Glinka. You can always find out about the programs and performers by looking at the official site www.opus-universum.com. We will be very happy for you!

Love for Life is a topic that illuminates once every person, someone remains forever, and someone loses a valuable thread, a leading person to the disclosure of the most important gift inside a person given to each of us by God at birth. Today, dear readers, you will receive not only answers to questions about life, about happiness, but also receive a charge of creative energy, which will help many more to live their lives and connect the links of themselves, burning with something special, giving fire and passion in every day of your life!
Visiting Women’s Time, Elena Tarasova is a person who has not only found her way, reveals her talent, but also does her best to reveal creativity and children's joy in other people. </b> <br> <br>
<b> FACTS </b> <br> <br>
<b> Elena Tarasova - pianist, graduate of the Moscow Conservatory (class of professor, People's Artist of the Russian Federation S. L. Dorensky and professor, Honored Artist of the Russian Federation P. T. Nersesyan; accompanist art - class of professor, Honored Artist of the Russian Federation M. I. Kravchenko; chamber ensemble - the class of professor, People's Artist of the Russian Federation T. A. Alikhanov), laureate of international competitions, laureate of the prize "Golden Lyre". Female face of the year. The creative elite of Moscow ”, a teacher at the Moscow Conservatory, a member of the World Piano Teachers Association, the author of ideas and artistic director of a number of youth music projects. </b> <br> <br>

<b> "I will wish all people to find a creative approach to their life and all its affairs inside themselves - this is very important ..." </b>

<br> <br>
“For me, a musician is not a job or a profession, it is a way of life - and, perhaps, its natural order. “I go to the conservatory to the students”, “I have a concert in the evening”, “I go to the rehearsal” ... what is behind these words, what is happening at this moment? Job? Formally, yes. But, in essence, this is the time of existence in that reality, where fatigue is not felt, imperceptibly over time, you do not want to leave - this is a creative laboratory in which the search takes place - deep and sometimes painful, ideas crystallize, new meanings open up, parallels appear, allusions , images ... In a few hours you will leave the instrument until the next meeting, but the activity of your inner creative laboratory does not stop here - now the processes of understanding everything that was done during the rehearsal will be vatsya along with your existence in the real world and all its variety of events. Feelings, impressions, experiences, overcoming are new colors, new shades of your world perception that cannot but reflect on the process of creativity. Life and the creative process is one thing. Rather, even life is a creative process, and vice versa, ”<b> our conversation began with these wonderful words. </b>
<br> <br>
<b> WT: What do you think is the result of "work"? </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Elena: </b> I would call going to the stage as a subtotal. The concert is like a moment of truth, like a bright flash of light that illuminates the path of creative search already passed and emphasizes something invisible to you earlier. There is also a feeling of happiness - from the fact that now you have done something in a new way, differently than before; I dare to hope more deeply and interestingly.
<br>
<br>
<b> WT: Which concert halls do you like? </b> <br> <br>
<b> Elena: </b> I really liked the halls in Japan - for example, Kioi Hall in Tokyo, NHK Osaka Hall in Osaka, Alti Hall and Kyoto Concert Hall in Kyoto or Keyaki Hall in Sendai. It was very pleasant to play in the conservatory hall in Lille or in Le Corum in Montpellier ... Concerts with the orchestra were recently held in the Saydashev hall in Kazan and in the Yekaterinburg Philharmonic Hall - also a pleasure! There are many wonderful, good concert halls. But there are especially loved ones and relatives - the halls of the Moscow Conservatory, my Alma Mater. She appeared on the stages of the Small and Rachmaninov Halls already at a young age - as a student of the school at the conservatory; I liked to play there already. What about the Great Hall of the Conservatory is a special magical space, stepping on the stage where you feel the big creative wings behind your back. <br> <br>
<b> WT: You've been studying music since the age of four. First - the school at the conservatory, then - the school. Laureates of international competitions appear, you are accepted into the Spivakov Foundation and the International Foundation for Cultural Exchange. Begins an active concert, touring life. The concepts of "ambition", "star disease" are familiar to you? </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Elena: </b> Ambitions, of course, were and are - I suppose, without them there is nowhere in this profession. But I understand that they exist in me exactly to the extent that it helps, but does not interfere with work. As for any star - and in our thoughts never was ...
I don’t know my future, I don’t know what turns await me on the creative path and what is to come, but what I’m sure is is that the concept of “star” is not mine, it couldn’t appear in me and for him there will never be “soil”. After all, the fact that I have a tendency, a predisposition to this profession is the good of the Lord God; my knowledge and ability to work - from parents and teachers; what I am doing now, being independent, is my own point of view, based, of course, on all of the above. I do not think that there is an event that could lead to the loss of this gravity.
<br>
<br>
<b> WT: In an interview with Educational Channel One, you said, “The happiness of my life is my teachers ...” </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Elena: </b> Yes, and I repeat it with pleasure always. Happiness is not only creative - after all, it was possible to confidentially talk with them about life. They are very influenced by my worldview. The teacher-student relationship never existed; you became a member of the family. My first teacher, Olga Evgenievna Mechetina, understanding all the difficulties of periods of personal and creative development, raised and brought up very carefully. At the conservatory, the style of communication is changing, with you - quite rightly! - they speak as with an adult, but there remains a feeling of a loving family, not indifferent to you, your worries and problems. I am infinitely grateful to Sergey Leonidovich Dorensky and Pavel Tigranovich Nersesyan, Margarita Ivanovna Kravchenko and Tigran Abramovich Alikhanov for their attention to me and a very happy creative time. In professional terms, each of them gave me a lot - perhaps more than I could perceive in my student time; I realize many of their advice, I understand in practice only now - both in the performing and in the teaching life. <br>
<br>
<b> WT: What kind of performing activity do you like more? </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Elena: </b> I play solo, with an orchestra, in ensembles - I like this variety of options. Ensemble co-creation is an interesting and important interaction experience that changes all participants in this process, leads to new discoveries and understandings; you will return to your solo performing space differently. The pedagogical process is also seen as co-creation. And rethinking. Perhaps that is why I love long work in the classroom, a long process, and I do not like the system of short-term master classes, which also need to be conducted.
<br>
<br>
<b> WT: You lead an active performing life, teach at the conservatory. In addition, you are the author of the idea and artistic director of a number of projects. Why are you working in this direction? </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Elena: </b> All these aspects have a common denominator, a single creative nature. If you are fascinated by a certain concept that has appeared in your head, or the opportunity to discover a new repertoire for yourself and listeners, which for several reasons will not arise as an “external offer” - why not embody this idea? I really like the creative principle heard from Chulpan Khamatova: “It would be dishonest not to try.”
<br>
<br><b> WT: What are the most ambitious projects? What difficulties did you encounter? </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Elena: </b> The most difficult for me was the first project - the Festival "To the 110th anniversary of the birth of Francis Poulenc." His artistic director of twenty-four years old was studying at the time in the conservatory graduate school, played the piano and understood little in the process of organizing a large-scale project / smiles /. But she was fascinated by the idea of ​​presenting the creative heritage of one of the most charming composers of the 20th century very widely. The intricate intricacies learned already in the process of preparing the project - of course, with the effective help of teachers, the conservatory, and colleagues. The festival was supported by a number of serious organizations, was held in Moscow from December to April, successfully completed at the House of Music ... and then new ideas emerged that, with the experience gained, it was easier to implement. <br>
Another long project - “Russian Evenings”. He began his biography as a festival-anthology of Russian music, uniting musicians of St. Petersburg and Moscow. Project events took place in two capitals - and therein lay some complexity in organizational work. Subsequently, it became a multi-faceted cultural and educational project and existed for a total of four years. Of course, there were difficulties, but is it worth talking about?
<br>
<br>
<b> WT: In the 2014 project, you went beyond just a music project. In the Center for Cultural Innovations "House Scriabin" an event took place in a completely different format called "In Search of Beauty. Experimentum ". </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Elena: </b> Yes, it was an interesting experiment. Synthesis of music (in our case, music using soundtracks of nature sounds, bells, which sound not from the stage, but through the acoustic system of the hall and combined in sound with the performance on instruments, so modern composer Pavel Karmanov invented so remarkably) (an excerpt from the book Tonino Guerra) and multimedia technologies, which eventually created the illusion of expanding space, an inexplicable journey into a creative, vibrant world, complemented by the imagination of everyone who came into the hall.
In the experience of “In Search of Beauty,” I liked the fact that for some time this format eliminates the imposed stereotypes that give a person the inertia of existence, and makes him to be himself. <br>
<br>
Let's imagine ... A man comes to the concert hall. He knows what format is traditional for this place, how to listen ... The very first minutes of the action make him forget about everything and he turns into a child who does not understand how it was done and is surprised at everything. <br>
<br>
Modern text is illusory - natural, but momentary, you can save only the feeling of it, breathe it. It rains around you, the sounds of thunderstorm, rain, mushroom rain (yes, we begin to hear the difference, distinguish it!) Quietly merge with live music from the stage, and you realize that today in real life you can’t hear the music of nature. Along with the development of this ensemble of rain and musical lines, you feel the coldness of loneliness in the pre-night night, and the infinity of the stream of chilling water, and enlightenment, the emerging morning sun, a slight delight from the sparkling drops of mushroom rain, in each of which you want to see The rainbow effect is not an optical phenomenon, but a momentary miracle presented by nature, which now does not find its viewers - there is no time for everyone. <br>
<br>
Text and music are endless - there are no points in this score; the incompleteness of Guerra’s texts becomes the impetus for music developing a previous thought. The score of the action is made in such a way that the music also does not put points - it dissolves in space without ending, approval, passing the line of development to the text. In the meantime, the appeal to childhood, the light and joy of which seems to have not come to us for a long time. Once again, surprise - the snow around you, along with musical development turns into a blizzard, taking with you all the unreal that we live. The light score is the purity of a fairy tale, the purity of childhood ... The long-forgotten childish feeling of happiness that cannot be taken away ... Together with the music, the sound of a snowstorm appears, later - the Christmas bells ... <br>
<br>At this moment, the person does not know how to perceive and appreciate it, he perceives emotionally, being surprised and believing this illusion as a child - and, therefore, he feels for real. At this moment, a person is what he is by nature, and not what life in a complex metropolis does with work as a lifestyle and stereotypes as a means of subsistence due to the lack of time for serious reflections.
Music is melting again in the air and the word will reappear - with a very happy vector to the future - which makes you think about the present in our life. The music will return on the final lines of the text; for the first time, developing in one direction - to Beauty - they will begin to sound together. And for the first time the music and the text will be completed. <br>
<br>
It seems to me that after everything that has been lived in the hall, the real viewer will enter the world to others. Appealing to yourself, to your imagination, wandering through the waves of memory, through the pages of life, finding yourself as a result of long spiritual quest, traveling into the world of fantasy and dreams, constant return to Beauty and Love, turning to a different understanding of life - such is the range of topics which will revive again, will sound in him under the impression of what he saw.
<br>
<br>
<b> WT: What projects do you have ahead? </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Elena: </b> In October 2016, the International Music Project “Opus Universum” will begin its work (lat. “Opus Universe” - “universal work”, “universal creation”, “whole profession” - author's comment. ). It unites the performers, a kind of credo of each of which could be the phrase of the actor and theater director Juozas Miltinis "Do not look for new things in art, look for the eternal." Appeal to the eternal - and therefore always new - implies a deep spiritual search and courage of creative solutions; "Whole profession" is a way of life. I really hope that the project will be annual.
<br>
<br>
<b> WT: Do you have hobbies, hobbies, free time? </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Elena: </b> I love to read. Among the favorite arts are ballet and drama theater; when there is time, I strive to go to the play. Delights and unusually inspires what is happening in the Vakhtangov Theater! Rimas Tuminas seems to me a creative wizard. His aesthetic views are very close to me.
<br>
<br>
<b> WT: What do you listen to in your free time? </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Elena: </b> At different times, listened to different things. Today I want to admire something very simple, but at the same time deep, large-scale, having a universal meaning. Therefore, now I often listen to our contemporaries Arvo Pärt, Georgs Pelecis. In the future concert season for the first time I will play a program from the works of Pärt and Pelecis.
<br>
<br><b> WT: How do you define the role of art, its need in our life? </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Elena: </b> I suppose art is the phenomenon that makes us human. Accordingly, the importance of his presence in our lives can not be overemphasized. However, it seems to me that in this time the most necessary role is the peacemaker. And if the activity of a creative person, the direction of his art is in this direction - then it is not just very important, but urgent, vital.
<br>
<br>
<b> WT: What is happiness for you? </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Elena: </b> In the sense of freedom, the existence in the creative space, the opportunity to transmit good and light into this world, the joys of the feeling of love of others and a sense of gratitude.
<br>
<br>
<b> WT: Are you a happy person? </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Elena: </b> Absolutely. But I will say right away that I hear a man with a hammer. Remember how Chekhov? "Behind the door of a happy person, someone should stand with a hammer, constantly knocking and reminding that there are unfortunates ..."

During the festival “Les Pianos Folies”, Elena Tarasova, in addition to concerts, held master classes for the first time and also participated in the world premiere - in a concert of classical music during races at Le Touquet Hippodrome.
<br> <br>
<b> P.- M ..: Is it likely that you are from a family of musicians? </b> <br> <br>
<b> ET.: </b> Indeed, my mother is a pianist; Dad - an engineer, with a great music lover, a man really interested in music. The music introduced my parents.
<br>

<br> <br>
<b> P.-M ..: You studied under the guidance of big teachers - could you single out the main features of the Russian school, which so many musicians want to join? Usually they say that everything depends on the individuality, but is there anything else? </b> <br>
<br>
<b> ET: </b> Of course, individuality plays a big role, ... learning is very wide, it goes beyond the musical world, and in this way the teacher takes the student to discovering his own path based on his own individuality. .. helps him discover, feel and penetrate all forms of art.
<br>

<br> <br>
<b> P.-M ..: Your concert at the hippodrome was a world premiere. Wasn’t it difficult to play on the treadmill with such a very cold wind? </b> <br> <br>
<b> ET: </b> Yes, this is a common problem of all open air concerts, but I was happy to participate in the popularization of classical music, this is a great idea of ​​the organizers of the festival “Les Pianos Folies” who set themselves such tasks, and I I am very glad that I took part in it. <br> <br>

<br>
<b> Newspaper “Da Capo al Fine”, April 2013. </b>
<br> <br>
<b> The pianist E. Tarasova's creative journey is complemented every year by various forms of artistic activity. She successfully combines a rich performing life with pedagogical work and artistic guidance of large-scale musical projects. </b> <br> <br>
[...]
<br> <br>
<b> - What are your plans for the near future? </b>
<br> <br>
- There will be a concert summer - several programs in Moscow and in France.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> - Will there be surprises in the new season? </b>
<br> <br>
- A small project is planned, which, I hope, will be periodically repeated during the season as a repertoire performance. From October to April, the project will be shown in various concert halls of the capital, and will be completed in the Chamber Hall of the Moscow Philharmonic. This is a very important project for me. And very unusual, because for the first time in my life I want to combine performing and artistic reading on the stage.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> - How did this idea come up? </b>
<br> <br>
- She logically emerged from my thoughts about today's life. Megapolis, which dictates its insane rhythm of life, endless vanity ... There is less time left for the processes of reflection, reflection, and there must be more and more reactions. There is not enough time to not only experience some deep feelings, but also just to think about them. Increasingly, communication becomes external, without sincere contact. Values ​​change, there is a substitution of meanings. People close in their own problems and sometimes get lost - in a whirlwind of tasks, necessities, they no longer notice life, its joys and true values. I would like this project to make us think together and, perhaps, change our attitude towards some particularly important issues of our life - those questions, thoughts on which are sometimes supplanted by the need to solve other less significant, but more urgent tasks every day.
<br> <br>
It is necessary and important to return the original meaning to many concepts, if, of course, we want something human to remain in us. This "process of return" is brilliantly and simply begins by our contemporary - Tonino Guerra, whose writings will become the literary basis of this action. To turn to your soul, to memories and dreams, to childhood that energizes us all our lives, to overcome the crisis of faith, to return to positive values ​​- this is the path that Guerra offers us. And in the musical program mainly works of N. Medtner will be performed, whose work, in my opinion, is organically synthesized with T. Guerra’s poetic reflections. Remarkably said about the composer GG. Neuhaus: “... Medtner is one of those creators who evoke the feeling that yesterday’s should not be buried or forgotten as unnecessary, that it can and should be remembered that it can come to life, wake up feelings and thoughts, deliver purely artistic pleasure to that who is able to see and perceive in art and life not only one novelty "by all means" ... ".
<br> <br> <br>
<b> - What does a project look like? </b>
<br> <br>- In this project there are features of a one-man show and a piano evening, which, by the way, is also a one-man show by nature, but it seems to me that it would be most faithful to present it as a time of dialogue with the listener — a musical and literary dialogue. The themes of this dialogue are turning to oneself, inside oneself, to one's imagination, traveling through waves of memory, through the pages of life, finding oneself as a result of long spiritual quest, invariable return to beauty and love, turning to a different understanding of life. These are the topics that particularly excite me today. Each of us has our own Main Square, from the center of which we measure the distances of our space. This evening is an opportunity for me to thank Tonino Guerra, to bow to him. Meeting with him in 2007 changed my views and in many ways influenced my future life.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> - Will you play and read the text yourself? </b>
<br> <br>
- Yes, the selected texts coincide with my feelings, and it is important for me to pronounce them. Speaking from the stage is very unusual for me - traditionally the musician is silent during the concert and speaks the language of music. Therefore, this project was preceded by a long period of preparation with teachers in acting and stage speech.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> - Why do you turn to different types of creative activity? </b>
<br> <br>
- Difficult question ... I could say that I want to get new knowledge and apply it in my main activity, but the nature of these appeals is probably deeper ... There is a powerful impulse - a creative impulse that leads towards something new. I really like the creative principle heard from Chulpan Khamatova: “It would be dishonest not to try.” This is the beginning of a new creative experiment, a journey to a new world of creativity, in which I get a very important experience and in my “musical haven” I return another. Perhaps more interesting - first of all to itself. <br> <br> </ p> `

                                                <h3> Fragment of Elena’s interview with the Russian World Foundation’s radio station. </ h3>
                        <p class = "description">
                    <b> Dear listeners, I want to once again introduce to you the author of the idea and the head of the Russian Evenings festival, Elena Tarasova. </b>
<br><br><b> Elena - Winner of international competitions, a graduate of the Moscow Conservatory (class of professor, People’s Artist of Russia Sergey Leonidovich Dorensky and Professor, Honored Artist of Russia Pavel T. Nershesyan), soloist of the Concert Philharmonic Association “Mosconcert”, participant of the Moscow State Academic Philharmonic Philharmonic Society Conservatory, the author of ideas and the head of a number of youth cultural cultural and educational projects, including the Festival “On the 110th anniversary of the birth of Francis Poulenka "(2009), the concert-monograph" Evgeny Svetlanov-composer "(2010). Elena actively gives concerts, performs with solo and symphonic concerts in Moscow, from the age of 15 she has toured around the cities of Russia (over 60 cities); Performs with concert programs, and also participates in international festivals abroad (France, Italy, Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Japan). Helena's speeches were repeatedly broadcast on the radio station Orpheus. </b>
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Elena, in one of the interviews you said that the festival was based on your performing priorities. You are a concert pianist, the repertoire is really impressive. Why did the idea of ​​the festival of Russian music appear? After all, for example, in the 2008–2009 season, your first large-scale project, a festival dedicated to Francis Poulenc, a prominent French composer of the 20th century, went through with great success in Moscow. </b>
<br> <br>
<b> ELENA: </b> The Poulenc Festival was the first touchstone, the first experience of organizational activities. Fortunately, this experience ended well, but it was after this project that I realized that I would like to distance myself from organizational activities, which are clearly not in my area of ​​interest. Unfortunately, this is the kind of work that conflicts with the activities of the contractor. For a creative search and understanding of an essay, you must be free - internally free. And the organization process does not provide the necessary inner freedom. But the formation of the concept of educational cycles fascinated me - this is a very interesting creative process, in which you immerse yourself in studying the heritage of composers and reach certain depths of knowledge much faster than in life outside of similar concepts and projects.
<br> <br>
The idea of ​​“Russian Evenings” and the concert-monograph “Eugene Svetlanov-composer” as an element preceding the global project, appeared almost immediately after the Poulenc festival. However, we approached the opening of the Russian Evenings festival only two years after the appearance of the first impulses. In my opinion, the idea of ​​a consistently built cycle of programs that gives an idea of ​​the development of the Russian school of composition and covers a large time period is very relevant and necessary. The programs of the main Moscow cycle were formed very quickly. However, all this time I was tormented by the thought that, headlong into the organization of the project, you could lose the main thing in your creative life - performing activity, which implies constant self-improvement. Fortunately, there was a wonderful team - Maria Bakun, Yekaterina Gogoleva, Pavel Tchannikov, thanks to whose work they managed to carry out the project and at the same time maintain their priorities.
<br> <br> By the way, it was the brilliant work of these people that gave impetus to the idea that I hadn’t planned beforehand, namely, the idea of ​​a youth cultural bridge, for which the northern capital was chosen. The cultural bridge Moscow-Petersburg arose long before us, and in this we are far from being a discoverer. But the idea of ​​the possibility of uniting, within the framework of one project, representatives of two different performing schools, the founders of which were the siblings Nikolay and Anton Rubinstein, was attractive to us. In addition, performing communication in the framework of such projects brings together a large number of talented young people, and for each of them the festival becomes an opportunity to clearly express themselves and bring something new to the development of the country's culture. I am glad that in the northern capital the idea of ​​the project met such a warm welcome and is grateful to the St. Petersburg organizational group - PR director of St. Petersburg programs Nina Moskvina for her high professionalism, executive producer Vladimir Golovacheva for developing the printed image of the festival and active participation in the life of the project, and art director the St. Petersburg part of the project Galina Zhukova for the formation of the festival programs of St. Petersburg, complementing the main Moscow cycle is very interesting.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Can you summarize the project now? What do you think succeeded? </b><br> <br>
<b> ELENA: </b> It is difficult for me now to immerse myself in detailed analytical work - after all, the festival was completed quite recently, and it takes time to comprehend and analyze each step. But the main criterion for evaluating musical projects for me is always the performing level. It should always be at the forefront. It is impossible to talk about the promotion of musical heritage, presenting it to the listener in an unthought, incomplete form. And, if we talk about the aesthetic education of the young generation who seeks his reference points in the field of classical art, representatives of which we, fortunately, were often seen among the listeners of our project - certainly this generation should be brought up with artistically interesting and deep interpretations, the ground for which is knowledge and respect for the traditions of the Russian performing school. In my opinion, the Moscow programs of the festival were at a good level. Now I’m talking only about Moscow programs, since we will summarize the preliminary results of the Petersburg cycle a bit later, when the entire video and audio archive will be transferred to Moscow. But critical reviews about the project yet. And it inspires hope that we are going in the right direction along the chosen path.
<br> <br>
I would also like to add that at the end of the concert programs the official website of the festival will not stop its work. The news section will be periodically updated, in which everyone will be able to gather information about the process of working on future “Russian evenings”, as well as gradually be filled with video materials of the festival. With your permission, I will remind you of our Internet address —www. russianevenings.com.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Elena, the traditional question will not pass you: tell us what is in the near future? </b>
<br> <br>
<b> ELENA: </b> These days we are completing work on a cycle of radio programs prepared specifically for the radio station of the Russian World Foundation, and I am again immersed in the performing life. There are plans for the summer - a concert in Montpellier and a recording of a concert on Radio France, then three solo concerts in Moscow, a solo program at the Le Touquet festival - in the program of this concert only Russian music - the cycle “Seasons” by Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov’s etudes, as well as several of his transcriptions. In October, I perform the Four Chopin Ballads and Liszt's h-moll Sonata in Syktyvkar, and also prepare to record a solo CD. Pedagogical activity and the idea of ​​“Russian Evenings” should not be left without attention will add their strokes to these plans.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Elena, thank you. In the air, we will present a fragment of your performance at the festival gala in the Svetlanov Hall of the Moscow International House of Music. </b>

                                                <h3> Elena Tarasova: “Creating cultural bridges is interesting!” </ h3>
                        <p class = "description">
                    </ p> <h3> On April 18, the First Youth Music Festival Russian Evenings, opened by young musicians from Moscow and St. Petersburg, opens in Moscow. They will build a “cultural bridge” between the two Russian capitals and will perform two series of concert programs. The main goal of the festival will be the popularization of Russian classical music, presented in a broad historical perspective, for which rare, but noteworthy works will be included in the concert programs. </ H3>

<h3> Before the start of this cultural event of the two capitals, in the very first year of a very large scale, its leader Yelena Tarasova spoke with Classica.FM correspondent Asya Sollertinskaya in detail about the upcoming festival. </ h3> <br>
<b> Asya Sollertinskaya: </b> Today, the musical life of Moscow and St. Petersburg is as rich as in any period of history. Festivals of classical music are born one after another, some, however, just as quickly disappear. Usually, the first holding of a new festival is modest - even Valery Gergiev’s Easter Festival, the largest in Europe, with which you meet deadlines, began 10 years ago with just twenty concerts. What did you come from, loudly announcing yourself in the first year?
<br> <br><b> Elena Tarasova: </b> The idea of ​​the festival crystallized out of my performing interests. Probably, in my case, the “mechanism” of the emergence of such ideas is always the same when performing preferences turn into monograph projects. This has already happened twice: in cases with a long festival devoted to the 110th anniversary of the birth of Francis Poulenc and with a program representing the composer's legacy of the great Maestro Yevgeny Svetlanov.
<br> <br>
But unlike those projects, the “Russian Nights” programs cover an impressive time period. In fact, this is an attempt to present the heritage of the Russian school of composition in a certain sequence - from Glinka to the composers of the twentieth century, with an appeal to rarely performed opuses and a reflection of the anniversary dates of the concert season.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Asya Sollertinskaya: </b> In the mentioned projects you act not only as a performer, but also coordinate an organizational process. At one time, your projects received a wide response in the press, and after the Francis Poulenc Festival, you were awarded the Golden Lyre award. Are you so interested in the organizational process? <br> <br>

<b> Elena Tarasova: </b> My “appearance” in these projects as the author of the idea and the head is in no way connected with the desire to engage in management, producing. This is simply the idea of ​​the performer, perhaps having a tendency to form cultural and educational concepts - and an attempt to translate this idea.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Asya Sollertinskaya: </b> But this time, you stated before yourself a serious goal - a multi-faceted cultural and educational project in two cities at once. Do you think it was necessary?
<br> <br>
<b> Elena Tarasova: </b> They are needed, they are always needed! I sincerely hope that this project will fulfill its mission and will contribute to the expansion of the concert repertoire of young performers, the emergence of new features of the performing style of Moscow and St. Petersburg musicians as a result of creative dialogue, the return to life of undeservedly forgotten compositions. In promoting opuses of young composers - in June, a joint creative action of the Russian Evenings festival and the project “Time for Music: Fin de siècle” will take place. As part of this action, a completely new music will sound. <br> <br>
I would not like to ignore another important issue - the education of the modern enlightened listener. Our project will not solve global problems - it is modest for this. But I think he will be able to take a number of very important steps in the indicated areas, thereby fulfilling his purpose. The festival is not narrowly specialized, we expect interest in the project from the broad audience.
<br> <br>In addition, the educational mission of the project is not limited to specific dates and single performances. The program of the festival "Russian Evenings" will be aired on the radio station Orpheus. Also during the festival a cycle of enlightening radio programs will be recorded for Moscow programs - especially for the radio station of the Russian World Foundation.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Asya Sollertinskaya: </b> You rely on young people, young talents. What is the response of such a youth initiative today? From whom do you get support?
<br> <br>
<b> Elena Tarasova: </b> A serious youth initiative always finds a response. The youth projects are treated with interest, they are waiting for new, bold decisions, unconventional approaches, extraordinary interpretations. The great happiness of our project is the receipt of approval and support from leading cultural and art figures, who are included in the Board of Trustees of the festival. Let not the fact that there are not only musicians in the Council, but also actors and directors are not surprised. In this case, they all act, first of all, as public figures advocating the preservation and enhancement of the traditions of Russian culture, for turning to the national heritage of the country.
<br> <br>
As for the technical issues of the implementation of our project, they are solved with the support of a number of organizations: the Concert Philharmonic Association "Moskontsert", the Moscow Musical Society, St. Petersburg University of Culture and Arts, St. Petersburg State University.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Asya Sollertinskaya: </b> Let's turn to the Moscow part of the festival programs. How are they formed? What works we can hear, what musical rarities you have prepared for us?
<br> <br>
<b> Elena Tarasova: </b> The basis of the festival is a consistently built cycle of programs. This is a cycle reflecting the jubilees of the season, telling about the interweaving of the fate of contemporary composers. There will be a number of works that can be called repertoire rarities. The concert-monograph will be devoted to the opuses of Anton Arensky, whose 150th anniversary will be celebrated by the music world this season. With this program we open the festival. Then begins a consecutive excursion through the pages of the history of the Russian school of composition.
<br> <br>
The second concert will feature piano and vocal compositions by Glinka, Borodin, Balakirev, Lyadov’s fairy-tale film “The Magic Lake” in the piano version by Mikhail Dubov and Suite after the opera “Boris Godunov” by Mussorgsky — the symphony of bells. It was created by Igor Khudoley in 1988. The third concert is dedicated to the piano music of the brothers Anton and Nikolai Rubinstein and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky - the program of the concert will consist of plays-dedication addressed by the composers to each other.
<br> <br>The program of the fourth concert will feature the Taneyev, Rimsky-Korsakov opuses for wind instruments, as well as Myaskovsky's symphony for brass orchestra. The fifth evening - the early and rarely performed compositions by Rachmaninov and Scriabin. The program of the sixth concert - works of Prokofiev and Shostakovich, written in the same 1943, in wartime. This concert will be complemented by a story about the musical life of Moscow and St. Petersburg during the war.
<br> <br>
The program of the seventh concert will allow the general public to get acquainted with the composer's heritage of the Maestro Evgeny Fedorovich Svetlanov. Few people know that Svetlanov graduated from the Moscow Conservatory in two specialties - opera and symphonic conducting and composition. He saw his vocation in composing activity, and conducting was consonant with his intention to “revive undeservedly forgotten works, and, first of all, Russian classics, to life”. Svetlanov, the composer, contrasts strongly with the trends of modern music in the form of stunning simplicity. In the second part, the program of the concert will continue the poem by George Sviridov to Sergey Yesenin’s Poems of Rus', poems by Sergey Yesenin. <br> <br>
The final concert of the festival promises to be a striking action - Prokofiev's Waltzes Symphony Suite, Shostakovich's First Ballet Suite, Svetlanov's Piano Concerto and Andrei Eshpai's Concerto for Solo Trumpet, Piano, Vibraphone and Double Bass, which will be the culminating point of the program. br>

Each concert will be accompanied by small stories about the sounding compositions, the period of their creation and their future, about the programs of some of them. Let's open some "veils of secrets". Maria Bakun, a musicologist, a graduate student at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, who not only prepares to defend her dissertation, but also works in a project as an executive director, took on the compilation of the texts. I can call her the second person and stronghold of the Russian Evenings festival and thank you for the detail and meticulous work, correctness, responsibility, mobility and concentration.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Asya Sollertinskaya: </b> In what halls can you hear the Moscow program of the festival?
<br> <br>
<b> Elena Tarasova: </b> We will meet with our listeners in the Concert Hall "On Kislovka", the Glinka Museum of Musical Culture, the Grand Palace of the Museum-Estate "Kuskovo", in the Scriabin and Prokofiev Museums, in the Cultural Center of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Of the Russian Federation and in the Svetlanov Hall of the Moscow International House of Music.
<br> <br>
It remains to add that the organizers tried to make the concerts as accessible as possible - the project is social in nature. Only in some cases will need an entrance ticket. For example, to a concert of a brass band at the Kuskovo Manor Museum, as this is a charity concert in favor of the restoration of a painting from the museum collection. For a concert at the Svetlanov Hall of the House of Music, the cost of tickets is small, from 100 to 300 rubles. 500 rubles - only VIP-sector.
<br> <br>
However, I would like to go back to the project development period. When the Moscow programs were formed, I thought about expanding the geography of the festival - I didn’t want to limit the idea of ​​Russian Evenings to one city’s borders. To entice this idea to the youth of other cities, to come up with "cultural bridges" that allow each participant to express themselves and bring something new to the development of the country's culture - this was more interesting.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Asya Sollertinskaya: </b> Why did you choose Petersburg?<br> <br>
<b> Elena Tarasova: </b> Actually, the cultural bridge between the two capitals appeared long before us and, fortunately, was never interrupted. It seemed to me interesting to give impetus to the start of a new dialogue - the youth creative dialogue of two piano schools, the founders of which were the brothers Nikolai and Anton Rubinstein, the founders of the Moscow and St. Petersburg conservatories.
<br> <br>
In a conversation about “building a bridge” with the northern capital, Maria suggested turning to the idea of ​​“Russian Evenings” Galina Zhukova, a graduate of the St. Petersburg Conservatory who combines performing life with active work in the field of art management. Galina is really a talented organizer - in the St. Petersburg programs she managed to unite strong creative forces, to interest this idea and soloists, to invite three established groups. “Russian Evenings” in St. Petersburg will be presented in the form of five concert programs, in which rarely performed compositions of classics and premieres of young composers will be performed.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Asya Sollertinskaya: </b> And what will you present to the Petersburg listeners?
<br> <br>
<b> Elena Tarasova: </b> The opening of the St. Petersburg programs, the works of Glinka and Tchaikovsky, will be held in the Elaginoostrovsky Palace Museum. The next two concerts, Rimsky-Korsakov, Andreev, Kuprevich, performed by the orchestra of Russian folk instruments and a concert for the anniversary of Arensky, will be held in the auditorium of St. Petersburg State University. A piano evening from the works of Balakirev and Tchaikovsky will be performed at the Sheremetev Palace, and the final program, a joint creative action of the Russian Evenings festival and the St Petersburg Music Time: Fin de siècle festival, will be presented at the Mikhail Shemyakin Foundation. The program will feature compositions by the laureates of the compositional competition, which is held by the St. Petersburg Center for Contemporary Music reMusik.org.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Asya Sollertinskaya: </b> Petersburg and Moscow programs are not repeated?
<br> <br>
<b> Elena Tarasova: </b> The main condition for the formation of concert programs of the festival was the absence of repetitions of compositions. This condition is met.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Asya Sollertinskaya: </b> The creative action “Cultural Bridge Moscow - St. Petersburg” ends a few days ago, which precedes the Russian Evenings festival.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Elena Tarasova: </b> Yes, this pre-festival marathon is almost complete. It lasts from January of this year. During this time, the audience of the festival was formed in both capitals, the listener got acquainted with the ideas and goals of the project, the performers, discovered new young names. Within the framework of the action Petersburg is a more active participant than Moscow. But within the framework of the Russian Evenings festival itself, the programs of St. Petersburg are, rather, an addition to the main cycle. I hope that in the future we will continue the youth co-creation of the two capitals and will be equally represented. I sincerely want this.
<br> <br>
Also with great gratitude I call a few more names, which by the nature of their activities are in a certain shadow. First of all, it is Nina Moskvin - PR-director of the project in St. Petersburg. She joined the project later, about two months ago, but brought many good and important events to his fate. Executive producer Vladimir Golovachyov selflessly worked on the layout of numerous printed materials, not allowing time trouble to influence the high professionalism of his work. Executive producers Ekaterina Gogoleva and Pavel Tchannikov, despite their great demand, actively help and support in the incarnation of not the first idea. I am grateful to everyone who participates in the development of the project, who fanatically, in a good sense of the word, works for the future result.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Asya Sollertinskaya: </b> What are your personal impressions of St. Petersburg itself, did you have to perform on the St. Petersburg stage, work with St. Petersburg musicians?
<br> <br>
<b> Elena Tarasova: </b> Yes, and more than once. For the first time, she was in St. Petersburg in the late 90s, in the status of scholarship holder of the Vladimir Spivakov International Charitable Foundation. I remember that I played with great inspiration - the impressions of the previous excursion days left their deep mark. And they greeted me very warmly. I sincerely love this city, I come with pleasure in the summer, I go to museums.
<br> <br> <br>
<b> Asya Sollertinskaya: </b> Already see the festival in perspective, for future years?
<br> <br>
<b> Elena Tarasova: </b> A difficult question ... I will say one thing - the planned vector of the project’s development is there. But let's first finish the first festival and summarize it. <br> <br> <p> </ p>

                    <b> Catherine Gogoleva. </b>
<br>
<b> Book Club ‘BookWeek’, 2010. </b>
<br> <br>
Home libraries are collected according to a book, like a handful of gold bit by bit, like a necklace - by a gem, and also like a mosaic, when you patiently pick up pieces of smalt to put together a whimsical, delightful pattern. It is with the mosaic that the young pianist, laureate of international competitions, the author of the most interesting musical projects Elena Tarasova compares her book collection. Music, theater, art - an incomplete list of what attracts Helen, but among many and different books she would like to meet those same eight or ten, for which it is necessary to read "fifteen thousand volumes."
<br> <br>
<b> Elena, from which books did your home library start? </b>
<br> <br>
<b> Elena: </b> Most of the home library was collected by my parents. Among the Russian classics, it represented mainly Pushkin, Lermontov, Turgenev, Kuprin, Tolstoy, Bulgakov, Blok, Paustovsky, among foreign authors - Shakespeare, Dickens, Dumas, Stendhal, Flaubert. The first shelves of the bookcase were occupied by literature for children. My favorite childhood books are still on these shelves - “The Country of Oz” by LF Baum, Russian fairy tales with stunning illustrations, “Niels Holgersson’s amazing journey with wild geese” S. Lagerlöf, “Black Chicken, or Underground People” A Pogorelsky, “The House with Magic Windows” and “Marina Petrova's School Year” by E. Emden, “Theatrical Tales” by L. Ustinov, “Conduit and Shvambrania” by L. Kassil, “Two Captains” by V. Kaverin.
<br> <br>
At school, I read a lot and with great enthusiasm. Of course, there were board books - "Eugene Onegin" and "Woe from Wit", which I gladly recited almost by heart. A real shock for me was M. Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margarita. It is very difficult to talk about the favorite books of the classics, but nevertheless I’m close to the Fiery Angel by Bryusov, the comedy Beaumarchais, The Sufferings of the Young Werther by Goethe, the Garnet Bracelet by Kuprin - more than once returned to the latter because of the appearance of the piano sonata Beethoven op. 2 number 2.
<br> <br>
Now I supplement our library. The discovery of recent times - the books of the modern French author E.-E. Schmitt My first acquaintance with his work took place at the E. Vakhtangov Theater, where several years ago performances of Schmitt's plays were staged: "Dedication to Eve (Mysterious variations)" and "Frederick, or the Boulevard of Crimes". Both the literary basis and the performances themselves made a strong impression. The play “Frederick” turned out to be not only a bright, perhaps unforgettable action, but also a powerful impetus for creating my first major project. In the musical arrangement of this performance, fragments of the Organ Concerto by F. Poulenc were used. How exactly this music was chosen! How organically it merged with the atmosphere of the play, reflecting the state of the main characters! I was struck by the combination of the musical material Tres calme from the Organ Concert and the reading of Racine V. S. Lanovym (Frederic Lemaitre) and A. Dubrovskaya (Berenice) in the actors' rehearsal scene. I left the theater that evening with confidence to come up with a dedication program for the anniversary of Poulenc - everything I saw there seemed to reveal new meanings and images of this music unknown to me before. So modest at first the idea grew into a large-scale festival called “To the 110th anniversary of the birth of Francis Poulenc”. I really wanted this Schmitt play to be in the home library, but it was not among the author’s books published in Russian and presented in bookstores in Moscow. But Schmitt’s writings were nevertheless added to my library — these are the ABC Classics books: “Oscar and the Pink Lady” (the stage incarnation of this work can be seen in the Lensovet Theater performed by A. B. Freindlich), “Monsieur Ibrahim and Flowers Koran "," Noah's Children ", the novels" Sect of Egoists "," Ulysses from Baghdad "and others. From the preface to one of the books I learned with interest that the author himself is a graduate of the Lyon Conservatory with a degree in piano.
<br> <br>
There are also e-books in my collection. You understand the special value of digital libraries on touring tours - it’s impossible to bring all the necessary books with you if you have to leave the country for a month and a half. But the “living” book, of course, is closer to the heart.
<br> <br> <br><b> What type of publications are you interested in? </b>
<br> <br>
<b> Elena: </b> Books about actors, musicians, ballet dancers, art albums today make up a significant part of my library. There are no rare editions among them - it is just a “collection of interests,” but there are books, especially dear to me. For example, an album about J. Mazin, brought from Rimini. I first saw films with her participation when I was 16-17 years old. The admiration of this actress and the desire to learn, read about her as much as possible pushed to search for information, but it all came down to vocabulary articles, a short biography and a set of small materials on the Internet. It seemed that in Russia there was very little information about this amazing actress, or rather, almost no.

The only book I was lucky to find then was a collection of short stories by E. Prokofyeva, “Shadows of Light”. The last of these short stories, entitled “Now, Juliet, you can cry,” told readers about the life of Mazina. Later I was presented with the book “I Remember” (F. Fellini and S. Chandler), after reading which one could add new touches to the portrait of this brilliant woman. The brought album is a modest edition in Italian, which includes several interviews, a selection of photos, a detailed filmography, drawings by F. Fellini, in which Mazina appears in the images of Cabiria, Dzelsominy, Amelia Bonetti (Ginger).

Among the books of ballet dancers and ballet dancers, a special place is occupied by the book by E. Maximova "Madam" No ". I think each of us is well aware of all the difficulties and difficulties of the creative path in this profession, and, in particular, the path of Ekaterina Sergeyevna - after all, so many tests fell to her lot, so many dramatic events had to go through, survive, find the strength to dive into the creative process with the same, if not with even more dedication. But how bright is her story! Light, clean, filled with boundless respect and love for every person she has had the opportunity to meet and work with, or simply communicate.

From the books-monographs about musicians I will truly call a unique “Shostakovich. Life, creativity, time "Ksh. Meyer. The author does not just study the life course of the composer in detail, but also introduces the tendencies of time in the introduction to each chapter, the situation in the country, which is especially important when talking about music from the Soviet period.

Another beautiful book in the collection is “V. Meyerhold. The Queen of Spades. The idea. Embodiment. Fate "(compiled by G. Kopytov; ed." Composer "), which tells about the last completed work of Meyerhold - the production of Tchaikovsky's opera The Queen of Spades in 1935 in MALEGOT. The director conceived this idea for about 30 years. Of course, his concept can be called bold - and in relation to the text of Tchaikovsky. However, authoritative musicians called this production the pinnacle of creativity of Meyerhold and the Soviet theater as a whole. Intensive rental of the play will be stopped in the notorious 1937, which can be very accurately defined by Blok’s words, said long before that, in 1921: “... rest and will are also taken away. Not external peace, but creative. Not childish will, not freedom to be liberal, but creative will, secret freedom ... ”. The performance was banned. The surviving materials on the production of Meyerhold - the director's score, transcripts of rehearsals and meetings devoted to the upcoming event, letters, discussions, reviews, responses to the play, memoirs - are included in this edition.

From the books with autographs in the collection there is a collection of poems by E. Yevtushenko with his autograph, and a new edition of the novel “Angelica, Marquise of Angels” autographed by Anne Golon, who recently visited Moscow and presented this edition in the House of Books on Arbat.
