The project “In Search of Beauty. Experimentum ”is an attempt to present the genre of“ concert ”as a multidimensional space for synthesizing various areas of art; This is an experiment in the form of a synthesis of multimedia technologies, artistic reading and performance of the compositions of one of the most interesting composers of the 21st century - Pavel Karmanov.
<br>
<br>
“The modern can become eternal if it carries big questions, deep ideas ...”, said K. S. Stanislavsky. In the complex disharmonious modern world, Karmanov rediscovers tenderness and beauty for us, refusing dissonance, and chooses harmony as the main and eternal means for transmitting deep inner states. Search and finding of beauty, which become almost an end in itself for the composer, allow us to synthesize his music with the high literary works of our contemporaries, who are called “the last man of the Renaissance” - Tonino Guerra (1920-2012). The compositions of Tonino Guerra, fragments of which will become the literary basis of the concert-action, are unanimously recognized and loved by the world community. They admire the depth and subtle poetics, surprisingly gentle and new to our disharmonious century, and are getting closer to the pantheon of immortal, timeless classics. Appealing to yourself, to your imagination, wandering through the waves of memory, through the pages of life, finding yourself as a result of long spiritual quest, a journey into a world of fantasy and dreams, a steady return to Beauty and Love, an appeal to a different understanding of life - this is the range of topics chosen for the concert compositions of Tonino Guerra.
<br>
<br>
In the project "Experimentum" there will be two ways to search for Beauty. The height of Guerra’s creativity, his sincere tone of confidential conversation with his reader, the poetic transformation of today's life and Karmanov’s musical lines combine to create a new concept of dialogue, understandable to the viewer, sincerely disposing and revealing his soul to the beautiful, true, and at the same time very simple. “Unite - it’s easier to save beauty” (Tonino Guerra).
