    text: `The original French review and photo report from this concert are published on Elena’s official Facebook page. Enjoy reading! Didier Messiaen, 08.22.2018: “Elena Tarasova is an outstanding pianist and, undoubtedly, the most loyal friend of Les Pianos Folies almost from the first day of the festival. Elena not only performs on her own, often at the most incredible venues, for example, at the hippodrome or at the foot of the church in Tuk, but also supports the speeches of her colleagues and associates. In the framework of the festival Les Pianos Folies, we saw Elena Tarasova both as a soloist of a symphony orchestra, and as a solo performer. And every time the audience meets her with joy and delight. In the game, Elena combines both the skill of a virtuoso, who perfectly knows the nuances of her craft, and the incredible artistic sensitivity, which is so necessary when transmitting emotions invested in music by the composer. And today, in the beautiful hall of the Touquet Golf Club, working in difficult conditions, Elena again charmed the audience, far exceeding the capacity of the hall. Elena Tarasova loves her listeners and always subtly responds to their expectations. Always gorgeous in her stage costumes, she demonstrates elegance and sophistication, which sometimes lacks modern artists. Elena Tarasova is a brilliant woman and actress. Is it possible to wish for more? "`

      subtitle: 'February - April 2018.',
    text: `<p class =" description ">
                    The author of the idea and artistic director of the project is Elena Tarasova <br> <br>

<b> The international musical project “OPUS UNIVERSUM” </b> (lat. “opus universum” - “universal work”, “universal creation”, “whole profession”) unites performers, each of which could be a kind of credo of an actor and theater director Juozas Miltinis "Do not look for something new in art, look for the eternal." Appeal to the eternal - and therefore always new - implies a deep spiritual search and courage of creative solutions; "The whole profession" is a way of life. <br> <br>

 
““ Opus Universum ... ”-“ Universal Creation ... ”I really like the name - and at the same time the idea - of the project. Indeed, it is possible to present as the supreme goal of the performer’s labor the involvement of the hearer in the joint act of creation. Not just extracting sounds in the correct sequence, but creating an image, an atmosphere, an instant, affecting through the souls of listeners the balance of power in the world, when every minute of living together in the Beautiful increases the amount of good in the Universe. Let it sound unnecessarily pompous, but, you see, it's beautiful! You will not regret any effort, if you have such a goal. Therefore, I wish success from the soul to young musicians and the project as a whole. Good luck, to improve this world! ”- welcomed the First Project“ OPUS UNIVERSUM ”Honored Artist of the Russian Federation, Professor A. B. Trostyansky. <br> <br>
<em> “The depth of the project idea, combined with the creative courage, professionalism of its artists - the successors of the traditions of the great Russian performing school, as well as the high class of its implementation, I am sure, will meet a vivid response in the hearts of the audience! .. I sincerely wish the success of the project" OPUS UNIVERSUM " and I believe that he will become one of the most interesting events of the Moscow concert season! ”</ em> - such a greeting to the project was sent by the People’s Artist of the Russian Federation D.L. Matsuev. <br> <br>

Head of the Artistic Center "Yamaha", Ph.D. Levko expressed confidence that <em> "this unique project will be held at the highest level, will be a bright event in the cultural life of Moscow ..." </ em>. <br> <br>

 
<b> The first cycle of the “OPUS UNIVERSUM” “Music of Time” programs (October 15 - December 23, 2016) </b> presented to the audience the trends of epochs and various directions that are shorter in time, but no less important and significant. The greatness of the Baroque, the harmony of classicism, the romantic categories of the sublime were combined in programs with a direction born from the sensation of a fleeting impression and passed into the centuries under the name “impressionism”, the graphics and geometry of the musical space of the 20th century were combined in the programs with the clarity of the school’s “new simplicity” concept. As part of the project, the Russian premiere of a contemporary composer Pascal Yakubowski (France) was held. The first cycle of programs was attended by recent graduates of the Moscow Conservatory, laureates of international competitions, combining active concert activities in Russia and abroad and teaching activities at Alma Mater - Anna Yanchishina (violin), Elena Korzhenevich (violin), Sergey Poltavsky (viola), Yevgeny Rumyantsev (cello), Elena Tarasova (piano), Miroslava Florchak (soprano) / Poland /, Nikolay Ageev (clarinet), brass quintet of the Moscow Conservatory “Modus Vivendi”; Laureates of international competitions Sergey Suvorov (cello), Mikhail Turpanov (piano), Alexey Kudryashov (piano), Olesya Kravchenko (organ), Elizaveta Simonenko (harp), Xu Kehan ​​(piano) / China were invited to participate. br>

<em> “Any cultural project in which artists who have connected their fates with our renowned educational institution are busy promises an atmosphere of free creativity and a consistently high level of performing skills. The program of a musical holiday is distinguished by originality and variety. It is remarkable that "OPUS UNIVERSUM" continues the tradition of the development of domestic art and creates conditions for the creativity of young artists, </ em> - noted the welcome to the project Honored Artist of the Russian Federation, Professor PT. Nersesyan. <br> <br>

<b> The second cycle of the programs of the “OPUS UNIVERSUM” project “Time Acquisition” (February 15 - April 30, 2018) </b> is a combination of chamber concerts and programs synthesizing the musical art and the art of dramatic theater, but leaving music to the leading role in this synthesis. The “Time Gain” cycle is a dialogue with a listener about the philosophy of life, the beauty of the soul, the strength of the human spirit, the strength and fragility of human feelings; This conversation through art is truly a wonderful way of sincere, trustful, deep dialogue with the outside world. Laureates of international competitions, artists combining concert activities in Russia and abroad and teaching activities at the Moscow Conservatory Anna Yanchishina (violin), Elena Korzhenevich (violin), Sergey Poltavsky (viola), Sergey Suvorov (cello), Miroslava will take part in the programs. Florchak (soprano) / Poland /, Maria Simakova (soprano), Nikolai Ageev (clarinet), Elena Tarasova (piano).

Tabakov, Alexander Limin, actress of the E. Vakhtangov State Academic Theater Maria Volkova. The CIVITAS Quartet / Belarus - Russia will debut this year’s project. <br> <br> <br>
