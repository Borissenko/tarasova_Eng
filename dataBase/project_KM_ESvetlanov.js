<p> <b> Project Press Release: </b> </p>
<p> Evgeny Svetlanov ... The great conductor who created many reference interpretations in collaboration with the State Academic Symphony Orchestra, as well as with numerous foreign groups. The ascetic and enlightener, who implemented a large-scale plan, which has no analogues; the value of the Anthology of Russian Symphonic Music created by him cannot be overestimated. An excellent pianist who performed on stage solo and as a part of various ensembles. After graduating from the Moscow Conservatory in two specialties - opera-symphonic conducting and composition - he saw his vocation in composing, and conducting was consonant with his intention to “revive undeservedly forgotten works, and first of all the Russian classics”. </p>

<p> In the framework of the concert-monograph, the works of Evgeny Fedorovich Svetlanov will be presented. </p>
<p> “My composer creativity continues the chain of the great tradition of Russian music. And therefore it may seem conservative today, but I am calm for the next generation: look at how interest in the music of Myaskovsky and Medtner has again arisen. This makes me believe that my music will know a similar fate. I like the vast melodic arches, bright, rich, rich harmonies and the polyphony resulting from them, or vice versa, like Mahler, the beloved composer of my whole life. On the other hand, the rhythm of my works is simple and subject to their melodies. In this area, I managed to find my personal style, a little in the manner of Myaskovsky, but without sharp chords like Shostakovich, by which you recognize him from the very first sounds ... ”. From an interview with E. Svetlanov (Repertoire, France. The conversation was led by Pascal Brisso). </p>
